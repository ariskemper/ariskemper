### Hiüëã, i'm Aris Kemper
I am a seasoned Freelance Software Engineer with a rich history in the tech industry that spans back to 2004. Leveraging nearly two decades of comprehensive experience, I specialize in translating technological aspirations into tangible realities.

Note on Commit Stats: You might notice a lack of activity in my GitHub commit stats. This is because I'm also actively engaged in my customers closed-source projects hosted on other platforms such as GitLab and Bitbucket. These platforms have their own separate repositories and tracking mechanisms, which means my contributions there are not reflected on my GitHub profile. Rest assured, I'm continuously honing my skills and contributing to meaningful projects outside of this platform.

With a committed approach to excellence, I adopt best practices like TDD/BDD to ensure the delivery of robust and scalable solutions. My passion and dedication resonate in every project I undertake, making me a reliable choice for initiatives that seek both innovation and finesse.
